### Guidelines for NODE

#### NEST

- Use dependency injection for services to improve testability and maintainability following SOLID principles
- Implement custom decorators for cross-cutting concerns to keep code DRY and maintain separation of business logic
- Implement domain-driven design with modules that encapsulate related functionality and maintain clear boundaries
- Use TypeORM or Mongoose with repository patterns to abstract database operations and simplify testing with mocks
